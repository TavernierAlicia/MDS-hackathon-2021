Firstly, you have to clone this repository:
```sh
cd /your-dir
git clone https://github.com/TavernierAlicia/MDS-hackathon-2021.git
```

### The database
Now, import the file "database.sql" on your database service
```
mysql -u username â€“-password=your_password database_name < database.sql 
```

Then, start the service
```
sudo service mysql start
```

##### Warning: 
My config is maybe not yours, so you can configure the port and host of the database in "conf.json" file

### The program
Go to the folder "MDS-hackathon-2021"
```sh
cd MDS-hackathon-2021
```

Now you can launch the program compiled for Linux OS...
```sh
./main
```

... Or compile it for your OS

```sh
go build main.go router.go routes.go datastructs.go
./main
```
##### Warning: 
The app is serving on 127.0.0.1:3000, if you want to change the DNS, you have to do it manually in router.go at line 55

Now, open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:yourport/ and TADAAA! :fireworks: :fireworks: :fireworks:
